# 4-PAM Modulation of Ambient FM Backscattering for Spectrally Efficient Low Power Applications
Design files of  IEEE publication: 4-PAM Modulation of Ambient FM Backscattering
for Spectrally Efficient Low Power Applications


Ambient backscatter uses radio frequency signals
available in the environment (e.g. radio broadcasting, television or mobile telephony) to transmit data effectively leading
to significant energy and cost efficiency increase. This repo
presents a novel wireless tag, which for the first time utilizes
4-pulse amplitude modulation (4-PAM) technique to modulate
the ambient backscattered FM signals in order to send data to a
nearby low-cost software defined radio reader. The tag is based
on an RF front-end that uses a single transistor controlled by
an ultra low-power microcontroller. The microcontroller includes
an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for sensing and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for RF front-end control. A proof-of-concept prototype is demonstrated in an indoor environment
with the low bit rate of 345 bps and power consumption 27 ÂµW.
It operated using a real FM station at 34.5 Km away and the tag-to-reader distance was tested at 1 m. The value of energy spent
in this modulator was 78.2 nJ/bit at 345 bps and 27.7 nJ/bit at
10.2 Kbps.
